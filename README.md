# Cheesy Path
Cheesy Path, a front-end webapp, is used for fast, intuitive point-and-click path creation.

The app is available at https://thegreenmachine.github.io/cheesy-path/.
Using Intellij we can use the "built-in preview" functionality instead - just open index.html and click on the little intellij symbol that should pop up in the top-right corner!
## Getting Started
```
$ git clone https://github.com/TheGreenMachine/cheesy-path.git
$ npx http-server # Or any other http-server - Note: this is if you're NOT using intellij's built-in preview
```

### Dependencies
